# What does it do

The provided code is using two instances of a Terraform module called "nginx-deployment" to create Nginx deployments in different namespaces, one for development ("dev") and the other for production ("prod").

# Decisions

### Module Declaration:

The module is sourced from the local path ./modules/nginx-deployment, indicating that the module is located in the relative directory modules/nginx-deployment.

### Module Configuration:

Both instances of the module have similar configurations, but with different values for some parameters and they are located in the separate folders, so we have an environment separation via folders - in this case `environments/dev` and `environments/prod`. 

- `namespace`: Specifies the Kubernetes namespace where the Nginx deployment will be created. In the development instance, it is set to "dev", while in the production instance, it is set to "prod".

- `app-name`: Sets the name of the application. In this case, it is set to "DevNginx" for both instances.

- `replicas`: Specifies the number of replicas (instances) of the Nginx deployment. Both instances have a value of 2.
- `image`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the Nginx container. Both instances use the "nginx" image.

- `container-port`: Sets the port on which the Nginx container listens. Both instances use port 80.

- `svc-node-port`: Specifies the node port to expose for the Nginx service. Both instances use port 30201.


By using this code, you can create Nginx deployments in separate namespaces for development and production environments. 

The module abstracts the deployment configuration, allowing you to reuse it with different parameter values for each environment. This promotes code reuse, maintainability, and consistency in your Terraform configuration.

## Production 

When considering production deployments using the given code, there are a few additional factors to keep in mind:

- Environment-specific configurations: Review and adjust the configuration parameters in the nginx-deployment-prod module instance to align with the requirements of the production environment. For example, you might need to set different resource limits, adjust scaling settings, or configure any additional production-specific settings.

- High availability and scalability: Evaluate the desired level of availability and scalability for your production deployment. Consider increasing the number of replicas or utilizing features like horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to automatically scale the deployment based on resource utilization.

- Security considerations: Assess security requirements for your production environment and make appropriate configurations. This may involve enabling SSL/TLS encryption, setting up authentication and authorization mechanisms, or applying network policies to restrict access. Using secrets to manage variables and pass them to a pipeline instead of manual management of the secrets via k8s secrets etc.

- Monitoring and observability: Implement monitoring and observability practices to gain insights into the health and performance of your production deployment. This can include configuring logging, metrics collection, and integrating with monitoring tools to ensure proper visibility into the application's behavior.

- Deployment strategies: Explore deployment strategies suitable for production, such as rolling updates or canary deployments. These strategies allow you to update your deployment with minimal downtime and test changes in a controlled manner before rolling them out to the entire production environment. 

- Version controlling Terraform code, utilizing infrastructure testing, and following a well-defined release management process.

- Access and permissions: Review and configure access controls and permissions to limit access to production resources.

- Continuous Integration and Delivery: Integrate your Terraform code and deployment process into a CI/CD pipeline. This allows for automated testing, validation, and deployment of changes, ensuring a consistent and reliable deployment process.
